### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

---

I develop Android apps with a passion for **UI/UX** and a genuine thirst for **knowledge**.

I'm a **self-taught**, fully **remote** worker, and it's been going great so far ðŸ™Œ I like experimenting with stuff, related or not-related to programming and I'm involved in the **Android community** as an organizer ðŸ‘¥ (Paris Android User Group, Android Makers, etc.) 

I like to work in teams where **user satisfaction** is a must and where ideas can be exchanged freely, in a **healthy** way ðŸ¤—âœ¨ I just believe it's possible to make amazing work without being a jerk Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ **#DontBeAJerk**

I'm currently working on `eLisa`, a French newspaper app gathering 40+ brands and packed with a good bunch of features ([more on this here](https://elisa.prismamedia.com/))

Well, your turn now ðŸ™‚ Who are you? Give me a shout!
